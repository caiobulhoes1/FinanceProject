A Finance Project consist in a Web UI using React to get all of the companies registered in https://financialmodelingprep.com.

We are able to create our wallet, adding the stocks.

The project`s not finished yet, I`m almost finishing the front-end.

For the back-end I`m planning to use .NET Core / C#.
